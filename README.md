## Introduction to programming through Python

This course covered programming concepts through Python, the course was targeted to beginners to introduce them to programming. The following GitHub repository includes different codes organized as follows: 

- Beginner Exercises: Input/Output, Basic Arithmetic Operation, condition, loops, conditioned based loops
- Functions: Here we start to tackle small-size problems by breaking our code into function
- Algorithms: we solve list-based algorithms, like finding the largest and smallest, using conditions, and loops.
 
The repository includes also the practical segment of our Exam.
